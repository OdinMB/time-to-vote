# ### 1. Formulate Your Query

# Think carefully about what you're looking for. Be as specific as possible about the skills, experience, or knowledge you need. For example:
# - "Colleagues experienced in fundraising from corporate donors"
# - "People working on youth empowerment programs in South America"

# ### 2. Choose Your Search Mode

# - **Standard Search**: Quick results for general queries.
# - **Thorough Search**: Check this option for more comprehensive results. Use it when:
#   - You want to explore a wider range of potentially relevant colleagues
#   - You have time for a more in-depth analysis

# ### 3. Review the Results

# - Look through the list of colleagues presented.
# - Read the relevance explanations and limitations for each colleague.
# - Check their objectives and activities for more context.

# ### 4. Generate a Summary (Optional)

# If you want an overview of the results, click "Generate summary" after the search is complete.

# ## Responsible Use

# - **Respect Privacy**: The app provides professional information about colleagues. Use this information respectfully and only for work-related purposes.

# - **Apply Human Judgment**: The AI-generated results and summaries are starting points, not final decisions. Use your own judgment and knowledge of Ashoka's context when interpreting the results.

# - **Verify Information**: While the app uses up-to-date data, always double-check critical information, especially for time-sensitive matters.

# - **Be Inclusive**: Don't rely solely on this tool for finding collaborators. Use it in conjunction with other methods to ensure you're considering a diverse range of colleagues.

# - **Transparency**: When reaching out to colleagues based on these results, it's good practice to mention that you used this tool to find them.

# - **Feedback for Improvement**: If you notice any inaccuracies or have suggestions for improvement, please report them to the app administrators.

# Remember, this tool is designed to assist you in finding relevant colleagues, but it doesn't replace the value of personal connections and direct communication within Ashoka.
